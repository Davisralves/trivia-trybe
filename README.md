## Project Overview

The trivia game uses the [Open Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) and was developed collaboratively using agile methodologies (Scrum and Kanban) with Trello for task management. The project started by following the requirements from [this repository](https://github.com/tryber/sd-014-b-project-trivia-react-redux#api-de-trivia) but was completed with additional features.

### Login Screen:

The game has a login screen where the user can enter their name and email. The email is used to request the user's Gravatar photo, which appears during the game and on the feedback screen. This is done through the API provided by [Gravatar](https://br.gravatar.com/), where users can register and have their profile picture displayed in the trivia game.
